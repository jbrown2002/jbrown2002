### Hi! My name is Jacob Brown
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am currently a senior Data Analytics major at Denison University, and I plan to graduate with a Bachelor of Science within Data Analytics with a concentration in Psychology.

This past summer, I worked at United States Track and Field within their Merchandise department. My main focus was researching past customer data in hopes of creating strong marketing plans going into the next fiscal year.

My interests are:

🏈 Sports 🏀
🎸 Music 🥁
🐶 Animals 🐮

Fun Fact: I went skydiving this summer!
